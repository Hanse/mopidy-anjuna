# mopidy-anjuna

> Elegant Web UI for the Mopidy Music Server written in React.js.

Note that this project is very WIP.

## Install
As of now, the only way to install is to build it yourself.
```bash
git clone git://github.com:Hanse/mopidy-anjuna
cd mopidy-anjuna
PORT=3000 npm run watch
```
Running these commands should start the client on `localhost:3000`. The Mopidy server must be running on `localhost:6680`.

## Todo

[ ] Seek bar
[ ] Proper queueing
[ ] Use URLs so resources can be linked
[ ] Animations
[ ] Search inside playlists
