# iodos

> Elegant Web UI for the Mopidy Music Server written in React.js.

Note that this project is very WIP.

## How To Use
As of now, the only way to install is to build it yourself.
```bash
git clone git://github.com:Hanse/iodos
cd iodos
make
make server
```
Running these commands should start the client on `localhost:3000`. Mopidy must be running on `localhost:6680`.
